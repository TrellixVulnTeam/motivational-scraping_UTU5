# motivational-scraping
Web scraper for lift-me project

Code is found in this path (file) *motivational-scraping\depends\Lib\site-packages\lambda_function.py* 

# Why it was built
We needed data for our project so this targets a website that virtually gives us unlimited data.

# How you can use it
If you look at the code you can easily repurpose the scraper to target a website that has nicely structed html.

# AWS Lambda ready
I know that the repo is large, but if you navagiate to *motivational-scraping\depends\Lib\site-packages*, you can compress all these files then upload it to AWS Lambda and BOOM you are ready to expose this scraper through API Gateway and use it for whatever you need!
